Don't try to open this with the simple notepad.
For everything that is with comment  //  in front  or between /* 
means that it is disabled , so there is no need to delete the extra lines. 

You can open this ex:
with notepad++
https://notepad-plus-plus.org/

and also use the extra pluggins
(this way will be better , it will give also some certain colours to be able to detect ex. problems )
