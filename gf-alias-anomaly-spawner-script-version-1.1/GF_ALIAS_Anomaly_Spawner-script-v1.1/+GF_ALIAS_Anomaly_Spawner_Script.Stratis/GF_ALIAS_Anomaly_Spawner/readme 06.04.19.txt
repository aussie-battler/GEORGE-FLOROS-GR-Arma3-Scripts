Notes:

GF ALIAS Anomaly Spawner Script  , is a configurable spawner for ALIAS Anomaly Scripts.
I was asked several times on how to spawn them automatically , 
without any editing in the 3D editor and create multiple spawns.
This is why i created this spawner :
The scripts of ALIAS are NOT included !
This Spawner Script is supporting the following :

Burper
Farty
Flamer
Screamer
Smuggler
Sparky
Steamer
Strigoi
Worm

Everything in the description.ext , is ready to use with these scripts.
There are settings for :

Debug
Max Number of the spawned scripts
Blacklist Zone distance
Safe distance spawn from players
Select ( scripts )

The spawner will work automatically , without need of placing Markers in the 3Deditor.
The spawn position will be random.

#CAUTION :
Inside the Description.ext , the initServer.sqf and the initplayerlocal.sqf , 
there are extra codes for Farty and Flamer Scripts.
If they are not in use , they must be deleted.
