Description:

GF Auto Loot with userconfig , will detect the enable Mods , without editing lists.
You are free to do anything but i would like to give me Credits for this!
Simple and easy to use and adapt .
Have Fun !


Installation / Usage:

To install GF Auto Loot with userconfig , you should use modfolders to keep it seperate from the official game content to prevent issues.
With Arma 3 you can use different ways to set up your modfolders to use custom content you have downloaded.
Please visit the Arma 3 Mod install instructions page for more information about using custom mods and addons in Arma 3.

Place the "userconfig" folder into your game install folder, usually:
"C:\Program Files (x64)\Steam\steamapps\common\Arma 3".
You may already have "userconfig" folder from other addons and/or mods in which case it is safe to merge the contents from this archive.
